## Overview

We are developing a robust and resilient **E-commerce application** in the `us-east-1` region of AWS, leveraging two availability zones: `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b`. The architecture comprises the following components and services to ensure high availability and fault tolerance:

- A custom **VPC** with public and private subnets across two AZs.
- **Internet Gateway** and **NAT Gateways** for inbound/outbound internet access.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute traffic to web servers.
- **EC2 web servers** running a PHP/Laravel application (FleetCart).
- **Amazon RDS (MySQL)** as the database layer in private data subnets.
- **S3 buckets** to host and distribute application and dummy data.
- **Amazon Route 53** for domain management and an **ACM** SSL certificate.
- **Auto Scaling Group** to keep the fleet of web servers resilient.

## Architecture

![Three-tier architecture](architecture.png)

The solution follows a classic **three-tier** separation inside the VPC:

| Tier | Components | Location |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Presentation** | Internet Gateway, Application Load Balancer, NAT Gateways, Route 53, ACM certificate | Public subnets (`10.0.0.0/24`, `10.0.1.0/24`) |
| **Application** | EC2 web servers (Apache + PHP 7.4 + FleetCart), Auto Scaling Group | Private app subnets (`10.0.2.0/24`, `10.0.3.0/24`) |
| **Data** | Amazon RDS MySQL (single-AZ, free-tier friendly) | Private data subnets (`10.0.4.0/24`, `10.0.5.0/24`) |

## Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | This document — the full deployment guide. |
| `architecture.png` | Visual diagram of the three-tier architecture. |
| `FleetCart.zip` | FleetCart e-commerce application bundle (PHP/Laravel) deployed to the web servers. The embedded `.env` ships with a blank `APP_KEY` — see [Security Note](#security-note). |

## Deployment Guide

The original step-by-step guide from [Roy Geagea/aws-dynamic-website](https://github.com/RoyGeagea/aws-dynamic-website), preserved in full below.

### 1- Create a VPC
To create a VPC with proper DNS configuration, it's crucial to enable DNS resolution and DNS hostnames. DNS resolution allows your VPC resources to resolve domain names to IP addresses, facilitating communication with other resources within the VPC and beyond. On the other hand, enabling DNS hostnames allows your resources to have meaningful and memorable domain names, making them easily accessible.

Here's how you can ensure that DNS resolution and DNS hostnames are enabled when creating your VPC:

1) Navigate to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC service.
2) Click on "Your VPCs" in the navigation pane, then select "Create VPC".
3) Provide a name and specify the desired IPv4 CIDR block for your VPC <b>10.0.0.0/16</b>. You can also choose to enable IPv6 CIDR block if required.
4) Under the "DNS resolution" section, make sure to select the option to "Enable DNS resolution". This setting allows your VPC to resolve domain names.
5) In the "DNS hostnames" section, select the option to "Enable DNS hostnames". Enabling this option will provide your resources with meaningful domain names.
6) Finally, click on "Create VPC" to create your VPC with the specified DNS settings.

### 2- Create an Internet Gateway
To establish internet connectivity within your AWS VPC, you need to create an Internet Gateway (IGW) and attach it to your VPC. An IGW acts as a bridge between your VPC and the internet, enabling inbound and outbound traffic. Here's how you can create and attach an Internet Gateway to your VPC:

1) Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon VPC service.
2) Click on "Internet Gateways" in the navigation pane and select "Create Internet Gateway".
3) Provide a name for your Internet Gateway and click on "Create". The IGW will be created and listed in the Internet Gateways section.
4) Next, select the newly created Internet Gateway from the list and choose "Actions" > "Attach to VPC".
5) In the "Attach to VPC" dialog box, select your desired VPC from the drop-down menu and click on "Attach".
Once attached, the Internet Gateway becomes the entry and exit point for internet traffic in your VPC.

### 3- Create Public Subnets
To design a well-structured AWS VPC, it's essential to create public subnets across multiple Availability Zones. Distributing your resources across AZs enhances fault tolerance and ensures high availability. Let's dive into the step-by-step process of creating public subnets in two Availability Zones:

Note) Before proceeding, use the CIDR.xyz website (https://cidr.xyz/) to visualize and plan your network architecture. This tool enables you to easily determine the appropriate CIDR block for your VPC and subnets, ensuring efficient IP address allocation.
1) Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon VPC service.
2) Click on "Subnets" in the navigation pane and select "Create subnet".
3) In the "Create subnet" wizard, choose the VPC where you want to create the subnets.
4) Select <b>us-east-1a</b> Availability Zone from the drop-down menu
5) Enter the name <b>Public Subnet AZ1</b> for the subnet and specify the desired IPv4 CIDR block <b>10.0.0.0/24</b>
6) Ensure that the "Auto-assign public IPv4 address" option is enabled in the subnet. This allows instances launched within the subnet to have public IP addresses.
7) Click on "Create subnet" to create the public subnets across the selected AZs.
8) Repeat the same steps for create a new subnet in <b>us-east-1b</b> Availability Zone with CIDR of <b>10.0.1.0/24</b>

### 4- Create a public route table
To enable seamless communication to and from your public subnets within your AWS VPC, it's important to configure a dedicated public route table. This route table will define the paths for traffic to reach the internet and other resources within your VPC. Let's walk through the steps of creating a public route table and assigning it to the existing public subnets:

1) Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon VPC service.
2) Click on "Route Tables" in the navigation pane and select "Create route table".
3) Choose the VPC you created earlier as the association for the route table.
4) Provide a name for the route table, <b>Public Route Table</b>, to distinguish it from other route tables within your VPC.
5) Click on "Create" to create the public route table.
6) With the public route table created, select it from the list and choose the "Routes" tab.
7) Click on "Edit routes" and add a new route by specifying the destination as "0.0.0.0/0" to represent all internet traffic.
8) Set the target of the route as the Internet Gateway that you previously attached to your VPC. This directs internet-bound traffic to the gateway.
9) Save the changes to update the routes in the public route table.

### 5- Associate the Public Route Table with the Public Subnets
Now, it's time to associate the public route table with the previously created public subnets: 
1) Select the route table and choose the "Subnet associations" tab.
2) Click on "Edit subnet associations" and select the public subnets you created earlier.
3) Save the changes to associate the public route table with the public subnets.

### 6- Create the Application Layer subnets
To establish a secure and well-structured AWS VPC, it is crucial to create private subnets for your application and data layers. By separating these layers into different subnets, you can control access and implement stricter security measures.

Let's explore the step-by-step process of creating four private subnets, with two in each Availability Zone:
1) Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon VPC service.
2) Click on "Subnets" in the navigation pane and select "Create subnet".
3) Choose the VPC where you want to create the subnets.
4) Select <b>us-east-1a</b> Availability Zone from the drop-down menu and set the CIDR to <b>10.0.2.0/24</b>.
5) Enter a name for the subnet, <b>Private App Subnet AZ1</b>
6) Repeat steps to create the second subnet for the application layer in the <b>us-east-1b</b> AZ, with name <b>Private App Subnet AZ2</b> and CIDR <b>10.0.3.0/24</b>.

### 7- Create the Data Layer subnets

5) Enter a name for the subnet, <b>Private Data Subnet AZ1</b>
6) Repeat steps to create the second subnet for the application layer in the <b>us-east-1b</b> AZ, with name <b>Private Data Subnet AZ2</b> and CIDR <b>10.0.5.0/24</b>.

### 8- Create NAT Gateways in public subnets
To provide internet access to resources within private subnets of your AWS VPC, you need to create NAT gateways in the public subnets of each Availability Zone (AZ). NAT gateways act as a bridge between your private subnets and the internet, allowing outbound traffic from your private subnets to reach the internet. Let's explore the step-by-step process of creating NAT gateways in the <b>Public Subnet AZ1</b> and <b>Public Subnet AZ2</b>:

1) Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon VPC service.
2) Click on "NAT Gateways" in the navigation pane and select "Create NAT Gateway".
3) Choose <b>Public Subnet AZ1</b> from the drop-down menu. This subnet should be one of the public subnets you created earlier.
4) Select the Elastic IP (EIP) allocation method. You can choose to either use an existing EIP or create a new one.
5) Click on "Create NAT Gateway" to initiate the creation process.
6) Repeat the same steps for <b>Public Subnet AZ2</b>.

### 9- Create route tables for the private subnets
To facilitate internal communication within your AWS VPC, it is essential to configure dedicated route tables for the private subnets in each Availability Zone (AZ). These route tables will define the paths for internal traffic, allowing resources in the private subnets to communicate with each other. Let's explore the step-by-step process of creating route tables for the private subnets in AZ1 and AZ2:

1) Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon VPC service.
2) Click on "Route Tables" in the navigation pane and select "Create route table".
3) Choose the VPC where you want to create the route table.
4) Provide a name for the route table, <b>Private Route Table AZ1</b>, to indicate the associated AZ.
5) Click on "Create" to create the route table.
6) With the route table created, select it from the list and choose the "Subnet associations" tab.
7) Click on "Edit subnet associations" and select the <b>Private App Subnet AZ1</b> and <b>Private Data Subnet AZ1</b>
8) Save the changes to associate the route table with the private subnets in AZ1.
9) Then add route for destination <b>0.0.0.0/0</b> to target the NAT Gateway
10) Repeat the steps for private subnets in AZ2 (refer to the architecture graph attached at the beginning of the article)

### 10- Create the security groups

### 25- SSH into a Private EC2 Instance via a Bastion Host
1) Begin by launching an EC2 instance in a public subnet.
2) Once the instance is up and running, establish a secure connection to the private EC2 instance using SSH. This process requires the utilization of the SSH agent forwarding feature, which ensures a safe and seamless connection.

For detailed instructions on SSH agent forwarding and its implementation, [click here](https://digitalcloud.training/ssh-into-ec2-in-private-subnet/#:~:text=You%20can%20SSH%20into%20EC2,located%20in%20a%20public%20subnet).

By following these steps, you can effectively SSH into the private EC2 instance from the launched instance in the public subnet while maintaining the highest level of security.

### 26- Fix Image Loading Issue in the Web Application
To fix the image loading issue in your web application, we'll terminate the web server in <b>Private App Subnet AZ2</b> and make configuration changes on the private instance in <b>Private App Subnet AZ1</b>. Let's proceed with the step-by-step process:

1) Terminate the Web Server in AZ2:
    - Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
    - Locate the web server instance in <b>Private App Subnet AZ2</b> and terminate it to remove any potential conflicts or misconfigurations.
2) Make Configuration Changes on the Private Instance in AZ1:
    - Connect to the private instance in AZ1 using SSH. You can follow the instructions mentioned earlier in the article to SSH into the private instance via the bastion host.
    - Execute the below commands:
        ```console
        $ sudo su
		$ cd /var/www/html
		$ nano .env
	      # in env file, change the APP_URL value to: https://www.example.com(replace it by your registered domain)
	   	$ service httpd restart
        ```
    - Verify the Fixed Image Loading Issue: Refresh your web application in a browser. The images should now load correctly without any issues.

### 27- Create a new AMI fom the latest instance state
To create a new AMI from the latest instance state and delete the previous AMI and its associated snapshot, please follow the steps below:

1) Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
2) Click on "Instances" in the navigation pane and locate the EC2 instance for which you want to create a new AMI.
3) Right-click on the instance and select "Create Image (AMI)" from the context menu.
4) In the "Create Image" dialog box, provide a name and description for your new AMI. This will help identify it in the future.
5) Review the instance details and ensure they are correct. You can choose to include attached EBS volumes and enable/disable the "No Reboot" option based on your requirements.
6) Click on "Create Image" to initiate the AMI creation process.
7) The creation process will start, and you can monitor the progress on the "AMIs" page in the EC2 service.
8) Once the new AMI creation is complete, make note of its AMI ID.
9) To delete the previous AMI and its associated snapshot:
    - Select the previous AMI that you want to delete.
    - Click on "Actions" and choose "Deregister" to remove the AMI from your account.
    - Next, navigate to the "Snapshots" page in the EC2 service.
    - Select the snapshot associated with the previous AMI.
    - Click on "Actions" and choose "Delete" to delete the snapshot.

### 28- Create an Auto Scaling Group
To create a new Auto Scaling Group using an EC2 launch template and the new AMI, please follow the steps below:

1) Delete the EC2 web server Instance:
    - Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
    - Locate the web server instance in <b>Private App Subnet AZ1</b> that you want to delete.
    - Right-click on the instance and select "Terminate" from the context menu.
    - Confirm the termination when prompted.
2) Create an EC2 Launch Template from the New AMI:
    - Navigate to the "Launch Templates" page in the EC2 service.
    - Click on "Create Launch Template" and provide a name and description for the template.
    - Select the newly created AMI from the AMI dropdown menu.
    - Configure other settings such as instance type, security groups, key pair, and any additional options as needed.
    - Save the launch template.
3) Create an EC2 Auto Scaling Group using the Launch Template:
    - Navigate to the "Auto Scaling Groups" page in the EC2 service.
    - Click on "Create Auto Scaling Group" and select the launch template option.
    - Choose the launch template you created in the previous step.
    - Specify the desired capacity, minimum and maximum instances, and other scaling options as required.
    - Configure the network settings, including the desired subnets and security groups.
    - Define the scaling policies based on your application requirements.
    - Review the configuration details and click on "Create Auto Scaling Group" to create the group.

## Summary

By following these steps, you will have created a new Auto Scaling Group using the EC2 launch template and the new AMI. The Auto Scaling Group will automatically manage the desired number of instances based on the defined scaling policies, ensuring high availability and scalability for your application.

## Security Note

- The `FleetCart.zip` bundle originally shipped with a Laravel **`APP_KEY`** value inside its `.env`. That value was **blanked** before import so no secret is committed to this repository. When you deploy, generate a fresh key with `php artisan key:generate` and set your DB credentials via environment variables.
- `dummy.zip` is a **Git LFS pointer** (the source `.gitattributes` stores it via LFS). Run `git lfs pull` to download the actual data before using it.
- Avoid committing `.env` files or AWS credentials. Use IAM roles on EC2 instances (see step 14) instead of static keys.
